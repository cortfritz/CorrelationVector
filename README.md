# Correlation Vector

## Background

**Correlation Vector** (a.k.a. **cV**) is a format and protocol standard for tracing and correlation of events through a distributed system based on a light weight vector clock.
The standard is widely used internally at Microsoft for first party applications and services and supported across multiple logging libraries and platforms (Services, Clients - Native, Managed, JS, iOS, Android etc). The standard powers a variety of different data processing needs ranging from distributed tracing & debugging to system and business intelligence, in various business organizations.

## Goals

- Make the standard specification externally available for implementation by non-Microsoft components or Open Source Microsoft components
- Support wire interop scenarios between Microsoft-internal and external tracing systems
- Describe the benefits of vector based tracing formats and to provide an exemplar vector based format for future standardization efforts with similar protocols

## Resources

- Design Constraints and Scenarios for the Correlation Vector: [Link](Scenarios.md)
- Protocol Specification:
  - [v2.1](cV%20-%202.1.md)
  - [v3.0](cV%20-%203.0.md) [In Review]
    - Support interop with W3C Distributed Tracing [Link](https://github.com/w3c/distributed-tracing)
    - Support for vector reset semantics to support traces of arbitrary depth
    - Support for versioning
